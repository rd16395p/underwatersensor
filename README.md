Using a raspberry pi along with envioPhat to log values for later processing. Script written by using example script found at; < br/>
https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-enviro-phat < br/>

Items used:  < br/>
Raspberry Pi Zero - along with sd card, power adapter, I recommend a headless connection over ssh. Use sftp to recieve files.
External Power Bank  < br/>
Mason Jar - I used a mason jar to create an air tight seal, but I am sure that other things can work too. < br/>

Run the file: < br/>
cd ~/Desktop/ < br/>
python3 log.py < br/>

Just drop in, the file will log for a certain ammount set in "time sleep" and will output the result as a .txt for later use. < br/>
